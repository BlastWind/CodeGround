# CodeGround

Platform for generating coding exercise sites. This project is in early planning phase and I am looking for collaborators!

# Motive

Developers learn languages mainly through reading the manual. This is not interactive.

I love the idea of interactive playgrounds like [Regexlearn](https://regexlearn.com) and [Typescript Playground](https://github.com/typescript-exercises/typescript-exercises).

CodeGround is a platform for advanced languages users to write their own interactive playground.

My grand goal: Learn awk through a playground made by a developer using my platform.
